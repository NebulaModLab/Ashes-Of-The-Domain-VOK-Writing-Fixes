uaf_supercap_slv_project,Rebirth of Solvernia,"Solvernia, the once-proud vanguard of the November fleet, the defender of the Aoi system, and a symbol of Auroran might, was, at last, defeated. Her massive powerful railguns that could tear entire ships apart in a single salvo, now brought to silence. Her armor, for all its resilience, breached all the same, scattered across unnamed volumes as debris. Your engineers look over her recovered blueprints. 'She must have taken decades to design and build', a young apprentice remarks. Still, they believe that they can do it a lot faster - just a few cycles with your reclaimed Domain of Man technology.

aotd_compound_project,Exotic-Mass Repolarisation,"Following a recent breakthrough in antimatter fuel synthesis, our scientists have uncovered a novel method to manipulate exotic particle states within fuel matrices. This process - dubbed  'Exotic-Mass Repolarisation' - realigns sub-atomic mass polarities to significantly enhance the energy yield of matter-antimatter reactions. Developing this method further and integrating it into our fuel production process and ship engines, our scientists promise a massive increase to burn drive efficiency, and an extension of operational range for our high-energy vessels, pushing the boundaries of deep-space travel ever further.","compound_stage1:20,compound_stage2:20,compound_stage3:20",compound:COMMODITY:300,"ability,physics",compound:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.CompoundSpecialProject,aotd_vok

Our scientists believe that by interfacing specialized AI cores with corrupted nanoforges, it may be possible to isolate, diagnose and even completely reverse systemic degradation of key nanoforge command-control interfaces and self-repair sub-systems, enabling us to return nanoforges previously thought of as permanently damaged back into a pristine condition.

However, while the hardware is now within our reach, the software required to bring them online remains elusive to us. 

Our head AI researcher proposed this project to resolve the issue, by conducting an in-depth analysis and reverse-engineering of existing AI cores in our possession to closely examine their foundational algorithmic structures. With the required resources and some time, this project will enable us to construct Beta-level AI cores completely from scratch.","aotd_ai_core_basic_algorythms_stage_1:20,aotd_ai_core_basic_algorythms_stage_2:20,aotd_ai_core_basic_algorythms_stage_3:20",beta_core:COMMODITY:300,"ability,computers",ai_core_production:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.BasicAIAlgorithmsProject,aotd_vok
pmm_champion_mk2,New Generation of Champions,"Every once in a while, one of your subordinates approaches you with a proposal for a very unhinged project. Most are too unrealistic to be practical, but this one has caught your eye, for some reason. You're not exactly sure who proposed you the idea of modifying a Champion-class heavy cruiser to incorporate a Domain-era Plasma Dynamo as its power core, but with the promise of a more powerful Champion-class ship, with a more efficient energy and flux grids, and an integrated arc emitter, your engineers agreed to try.

acs_junkhubship_build,To Brave the Abyss,"Based on some schematics and documents from the late Admiral Methuselah, the Djoeng-class Voidfaring Hubship was originally commissioned by earth Domain Explorarium Command, to serve as an exploration command hub in the furthest reaches of the cosmos, to be able to survive in the most isolated and barren parts of the galaxy, and, should a great cataclysm befall the rest of human civilization, remain the final bastion of humankind, to rebuild no matter what. 

And though it comes from a different era of human history, and will require an immense amount of resources and Domain-era relics to build, should it ever be finished - it will be the perfect vessel for exploring the most hostile corner of the Persean sector - the Abyss. A ship to not just survive, but thrive in it. With a massive independent shield module, designed to protect this ship without accidentally destroying it should it ever overload, and a dedicated onboard autoforge designed to not just service and maintain entire fleets in deep space, but produce entirely new vessels and automated defense drones from scratch, to ensure the survival of the main vessel in engagement, and to ensure that even if left alone, this ship will never be without an escort. 

It will be a massive undertaking and will have a lot of technical challenges to solve, but your engineers believe that they could just about make it work...","acs_junkhubship_build_stage1:20,acs_junkhubship_build_stage2:20,acs_junkhubship_build_stage3:20,acs_junkhubship_build_stage4:20,acs_junkhubship_build_stage5:20,acs_junkhubship_build_stage6:20",acs_junkhubship_module:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering,repeatable",acs_junkhubship_module:SHIP:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.ACSJunkHubShipProject,aerialcombatsuit
ix_radiant_conversion,Stolen Radiance,"The relics left behind in the wake of the First AI War wrecked havoc upon the IXth Domain Battlegroup during their arrival in the Persean Sector, and ensured that the survivors, among other things, have both great fear, and great respect for the automated Radiant-class battleships. 

Once open war between them and the sector became inevitable, IXth Battlegroup Fleet Command ordered their ships to go out and hunt for Radiants, taking in their disabled hulls back to their fleetyards for inspection and retrofit. These ships, once almost inaccessible to humans due to their automated construction, were stripped of all their intelligent machinery, gutted and turned into ships fit for humans to command. With standard, if awkward-shaped living quarters, bridge and life support systems, overtuned shields, recalibrated for human safety, and a built-in spinal Soliton Burst Emitter, the IXth Battlegroup Radiants became a mainstay of their fleets. 

Now, your engineers examine recovered Battlegroup blueprints. How they got there is unimportant, but they remark that the modifications made are very clever indeed, and, should we wish to, we could definitely build one, provided we give the engineers the resources and industrial capacity they need...","ix_radiant_conversion_stage_1:20,ix_radiant_conversion_stage_2:20,ix_radiant_conversion_stage_3:20,ix_radiant_conversion_stage_4:20",radiant_ix:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering,repeatable",radiant_ix:SHIP:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.IXRadiantConversionProject,EmergentThreats_IX_Revival
guardian_aotd,Guardian's Awakening,"The corrupted horror of a drone, usually spoken about by spacers only in hushed tones, the Guardian-class, is a terrifying sight to behold. A relic of the Domain Explorarium, twisted beyond recognition. Ships like this prowl the fringes, defending ancient arks and sleepers for reasons never told. 'To face one is to stare down the face of Moloch...' - say the captains of the Luddic faith - '...and to try and understand is to resign all that is to be a human'. 

Your engineers do not share their superstition. With ample scans acquired by your fleet, and with some creative system redesigns, they believe that they could build one of these terrifying beasts, chained and shackled to human goals, and your command, it will not feature an automated control system, but rather conventional crew quarters and a bridge. Upgrading outdated systems, and adapting twisted ones, your engineers say that such a ship will take quite a lot of resources to build, but once finished, it could be the key to dominate any battlefield...","aotd_guardian_stage_1:20,aotd_guardian_stage_2:20,aotd_guardian_stage_3:20",guardian:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering,repeatable",guardian:SHIP:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.GuardianBuildingProject,aotd_vok
ass_arkoship,Arkoship Construction,"One of the largest, if not the largest, classes of ships to ever find themselves in the Persean Sector, Archliner-class Arkoships were the crown jewel of Mbaye-Gogol. Closer to moving space stations than actual starships and designed to house tens, hundreds of thousands of people at a time in a fully enclosed, almost self-sufficient environment. A rare sight even before the Collapse, they took a massive amount of resources and manpower to build and fly, and were seen as little more than a vanity project, with no more than a dozen ever being built.

Though most have since been lost to the harsh sector following the Collapse, our scientists, through some uncertain, possibly clandestine methods, have managed to acquire almost complete blueprints for this class of ship, and with some creative interpretation of the gaps in them, our scientists believe that, despite their massive size, we could definitely build one. It will be a massive effort, but should we be successful - we will gain ourselves a brand new mobile Arkoship. Something no other faction has been able to do so far.","ass_arkoship_stage1:20,ass_arkoship_stage2:20,ass_arkoship_stage3:20,ass_arkoship_stage4:20,ass_arkoship_stage5:20",ass_arkship:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering",ass_arkship:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.ASSArkoshipProject,arthrships

Going further, our scientists believe they even managed to find some space for improving the ship's most unique system - the Mote Containment Array.

This sub-system relies on hyper-dense energy quanta, stabilized within localized phase-space distortions. While it still contains multiple components our brightest minds struggle to understand, they believe that some careful reinforcement of the array's stabilizers, and recalibration of the energy binding harmonics, should noticeably improve the system performance.",ziggurat_stage_1:20,ziggurat:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering",ziggurat:SHIP:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.ZigguratProject,aotd_vok

Despite this, you and your crew ventured there, and - whether deliberately, or by accident - attracted the attention of the things that call the Abyss their home. Hostile, glowing menacing red, and comprised of exotic matter, these entities - whatever they are - are unlike anything seen in the modern Persean Sector.

Rumors and speculations run rampant among the lower decks and superstitious crew, trying to rationalize the nature of what you saw, or just throwing around conspiracy theories, prophecies and horror stories.

Abyssal Lights, as our scientists have discovered, are uniquely unstable phenomena that appear in areas where the interdimensional boundary is particularly thin. As such, they are easily disturbed, with some of our sensor emissions being more disruptive than others. And the Shrouded Dweller - though we're still not sure what they are - are attracted to whenever an Abyssal Light is disturbed, with their response being proportional to the amount of caused disturbance.

They say that, armed with this knowledge, our sensor arrays can be modified to amplify the specific emissions that create the largest interdimensional disturbances in the Abyss, thus giving us the ability to lure an even larger Shrouded Dweller manifestation whenever we encounter Abyssal Lights.",aotd_shroud_understanding:20,shrouded_thunderhead:ITEM:250,"item,shroud,dangerous",aotd_shrouded_substrate:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.shroud.ShroudBeacon,aotd_vok
